John Masefield, <b>Sea-fever</b>  I must down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by, And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking, And a grey mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking.  I must down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied; And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying, And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.  I must down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life, To the gull's way and the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted knife; And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.
Roald Dahl, There's no earthly way of knowing Which direction we are going There's no knowing where we're rowing Or which way the river's flowing Is it raining, is it snowing? Is a hurricane a-blowing? - uh! Not a speck of light is showing So the danger must be growing Are the fires of Hell a-glowing? Is the grisly reaper mowing? Yes! The danger must be growing For the rowers keep on rowing And they're certainly not showing Any signs that they are slowing! A-aa-aaa-aaaah!
Arthur O'Shaughnessy Ode Music Moonlight 1874, We are the music makers,  We are the dreamers of dreams,  Wandering by lone sea-breakers,  And sitting by desolate streams  World-losers and world-forsakers.

Roald Dahl, So shines a good deed in a weary world.
William Shakespeare, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause... Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action.

Unknown Thai Monk, Sometimes you mix the past with the present, and your happiness disappears.
﻿You're Not Lazy. You're Dysregulated. One minute you're scripting, journaling, meditating, content planning, working out, and becoming "that girl"... The next minute, you're crying in your car, snapping at someone you love, or dissociating on your phone for three hours straight. You're not lazy. You're not broken. You're not sabotaging your glow-up. Your nervous system is just dysregulated. And no one ever told us that becoming your best self requires more than vision boards and routines it requires a body that feels safe to receive good things.
A foolish DOer will outperform a smart THINKer. Every time.
If a stranger studied your routine, what would they assume your priorities are?
When you choose yourself everything around you will choose you too.
Have a dream so clear that in your mind you have already achieved it.
You're so busy doubting yourself while so many others are intimidated by your potential.
Fucking start over. You don't need to cling to your accomplishments. Everything you did before was just practice. It's already used up. It'll never grow beyond what it already is. It's static. It doesn't define you. The best you ever did is holding you back. Let go of the past. You create the future. Everything you need is right inside of you. You choose how to use it. You're always getting better. You're never the same. You're dynamic. The best you'll ever do is still out there ahead of you, waiting for you to catch up.
Alan Watts, Don't be scared. It's all a show.
Just make it EXIST first. You can make it GOOD later.

Atan Watts, Stop measuring days by degree of productivity and start experiencing them by degree of presence.
Case Kenny, "The entire point of life is to take chances on dreams that seem crazy to most, but feel like destiny to you. Because destiny doesn't shout – it calls softly, only to the one it belongs to. The risk isn't in chasing the dream, it's in living a life that ignores it. What feeks absurd to others often holds the deepest truth for you. And the real failure isn't falling, it's never daring to leap at all.
The most magnetic thing on Earth is loving your own energy. Your perception of yourself affects your frequency. Love yourself, be confident in your talents and the way you express them, love the reflection you see in the mirror. May your energy raise the whole frequency of the planet.
This reality is nothing more than a hologram, which is directly influenced and connected to our consciousness.
Everything in life is a vibration. Atoms are in constant state of motion, and depending on the speed of these atoms, things appear as solid, liquid, or gas. Sound is also a vibration and so are thoughts.
Barbara Marciniak - Bringers of the Dawn, Information is light; light is information. The more you become informed, the more you alter your frequency. You are electromagnetic creatures, and everything that you are, you broadcast to everyone else.
The more playful you are about it, the easier it all is.
My 5-year plan? Live so fully that my future self never has to wonder "what if."

Too many ants telling bees how to make honey.
Be fucking impossible to ignore. Stand so tall that they can't look past you. Intoxicate with your presence. Be notorious. Remain on people's minds. Flow so freely that they'll be scared of drowning in your thoughts. Don't be taken lightly. Be sure of yourself. Be irreplaceable. Move so fast that no one can see where you're going. Give them something to chase, but never let them catch up with you. Be more than what they bargained for. Make them hate you for being so fucking good. Burn so brightly that you catch the whole world on fire.

The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine.
Give yourself 6 months. Take care of your body, mind, & soul. Give yourself 6 months to get into the habit of practicing radical self-care & self-love. Delete the apps, block the numbers, wake up earlier, get dressed up even though you're not going anywhere, eat healthier, journal, have spa days, & exercise. This is your ONLY life.

Shower Meditation: Every time you take a shower, visualize washing' away your stress and anxiety. Concentrate on the feel of the water upon your skin. Envision the power of the water washing away your negative thoughts. Feel sadness, regret, anger, and depression washing right off of you. Let it all go down the drain, you'll start to feel lighter and much more clear.
Whoever brings you the most peace, should get the most time.
FEELING DOWN IS A GOOD SIGN. Feeling 'down' is an indication that something within you is seeking to be released. Any negative emotion that is in your awareness is only ever there because it's seeking to be freed, it's not there to be pushed down, fought against or ignored. Instead of fighting that feeling, seek to understand why it's there. Negative emotion is often an indication that you believe something that either isn't true or isn't in your highest good, about yourself, others or what you desire. Take some time to meditate, view everything through the lens of love, allow it, be patient, the false belief will reveal itself and let itself out in time.
Wake up and start acting like your ideal self, imagine you are in a movie and you have to play this woman you've always adored. Talk like her. Walk like her. Dress like her. Act like her. Just for 24 hs, give it a try & you will be closer to you goal.

Your friends who let you sit in the comfort of your bad habits do not love you as much as the ones who challenge you to do better.
The best part of being a teenager is dangerously obsessing over something and calling it an era.
Being able to afford your lifestyle by yourself>
Randomly popping out looking pretty is my favourite hobby.
This current chapter is called "MY TURN"
Don't forget the lifestyle you promised yourself.
The less you tell the world, the better your world is and that's facts.
I am happy when I eat fresh fruit, when I burst out laughing, when I discover a new song, when I finish a good book, when I wake up and feel relaxed. I'm glad to have friends, family, a home, food when I'm hungry, hot water when I shower. I love being able to live and see the seasons change, to have gifts at Christmas and at my birthday, to travel sometimes, to have a good education and a great access to culture. I'm flattered when people compliment me, when peole smile at me, when people are polite to me. There are so many things that make life so simple and easy and I will always think about them more than all the bad things that will happen to me. I do not have time to be sad every day and ungrateful; I have every reason in the world to be happy.
My whole existence looks like its out of a fairytale.
make your bed. clean as you go. buy yourself flowers. have a morning skincare routine. have a cup of tea. find an exercise that you'll enjoy. make time for loved ones. change your clothes and remove your makeup when you get home. keep a journal. don't give up on yourself.
This is a total mind-fuck. So I'll give you a minute to unpretzel your brain and maybe read that again: Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. It's what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as "the backwards law"- the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place. The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. The more you want to be spiritually enlightened, the more self-centered and shallow you become in trying to get there.
Self care is creating a life you dont routinely have to escape from.
The body you want? Achievable with discipline. The career you want? Achievable with discipline. The life you want achievable with discipline. That car you want? Achievable with discipline.
Learning to say "Nah, this just isn't good enough," will enhance your life greatly. You're allowed to say, "This is simply not enough for me." You're allowed to have a vision for yourself, your life, your relationships and refuse to settle for anything less. Say "no," often.
I owe it to myself to look the best I've ever looked, make more money than l've ever made, & love myself more than I ever did.
If your body is telling you to avoid certain people, places and things - listen to it. Your body is your compass in the physical world. Learn to flow with It. Stay present and become aware of Its messages.
The audience only knows you made a mistake when you act like you made a mistake. Get it? You dictate the perception... Even if you fuck up, act like that's what you were going for.
You don't get multiple streams of income by focusing on a bunch of shit at once. You get them by focusing on one, mastering/automating, then moving onto the next.
I daydreamed chiefly about beauty. I dreamed of myself becoming so beautiful that people would turn to look at me when I passed. And I dreamed of colors - scarlet, gold, green, white. I dreamed of myself walking proudly in beautiful clothes and being admired by everyone and overhearing words of praise. I made up the praises and repeated them aloud as if someone else were saying them.
The cost of procrastination is the life you could've lived..." READ THAT AGAIN.
Getting rich is literally a game. It involves knowledge, strategy, foresight, patience and discipline. Get good at it.
You almost went back to the gym You almost started writing again You almost started a YouTube channel You almost started a podcast You almost started a business You almost changed yout life You almost chased your dreams. Almost is nothing at all. JUST DO IT.
Over sharing your plans is literally self destruction. Not everyone has pure intentions towards you. Keep your business to yourself and your close ones.
Appearing "high maintenance" sometimes saves your from bare minimum treatment.
Take care of your appearance, dress well, wear perfume, and use manners even if you're just staying home. beauty and elegance isn't only for the public, it's for you in your privacy too. a finer way of living.
You were born to be a leader, not a follower.
I deserve a life of luxury & I don't even mean designer bags/clothes. I just wanna be able to wake up ona random Tuesday and take myself to brunch, go get my nails done & book a flight, just because. I can't wait for that type of lifestyle.
One week they love me. Next week they hate me. Both weeks I got paid.

I am not one in a million kind of girl. I'm a once in a lifetime kind of woman.
Be the kind of woman that when your feet hit the floor each morning, the devil says, "Oh crap, she's up!"
Setting goals in private and just popping out with results.
I don't care to be seen, I pop out when I feel like it.
A designer's art is not exposed in a gallery but in shops catering to a non- selective public.
Don't deliver a product. Deliver an experience.
Never lower your price, add value.
Albert Einstein, Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that its stupid.
Two things to remember in life: Take care of your thoughts when you are alone. And take care of your words when you are wwith people.
Live your life and forget your age.
I've seen better days, but I've also seen worse. I don't have everything that I want , but I do have all I need. I woke up with some aches and pains, but I woke up. My life may not be perfect but I am blessed.
Lao Tzu, If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present.
